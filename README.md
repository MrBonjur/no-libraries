# Clean project without extraneous libraries #NO LIBRARIES
I was inspired to create code without the use of extraneous (installable) libraries.


## Advantage:

* Small weight when compiling.
* There is no dependency.
* Garbage cleanup code and does not contain superfluous.




## My list of projects:
* screenshot.py - Screen capture Windows 7 and higher and x64 architecture
